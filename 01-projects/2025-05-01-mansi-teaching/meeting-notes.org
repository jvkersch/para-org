#+title: Meeting notes

* 2025-08-06

- Survey response rate: 23 out of about 50 possible respondents, probably high enough.
- Survey responses are all over the place, indicating that people come from different backgrounds, have different experience levels, etc.
- Decided not to send out survey for a 3rd time
- ZAP training: Mansi will take the lead. AAP training: Conor was going to do this (based on online learning track) but with his departure this isn't so clear anymore. Jonathan will see if Jon N can take over (was also present in February for on-site meetings). "GUGC-ify" existing materials.
- ZAP:
  - Me to send out save-the-date
  - Mansi and Annelies to take over communication (need to send an email introducing them)
  - Me to share list of ZAPs
