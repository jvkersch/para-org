#+title: wetlab safety training

* TODO What is the status of this project?


* Meeting with Kristien

- Need to plan in time for students to take the lab safety training in week 1 of the semester.
- Lab safety manager collects training certificates, TAs check the certificates for their course (students bring to class?)
- Academic Affairs communicates the procedure to the students.
