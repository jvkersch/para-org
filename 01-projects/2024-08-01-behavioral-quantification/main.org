- Nature neuropsychopharmacology (IF 7.6): has similar papers from 2020, probably need to show something really new.

- PLOS computational biology (IF 3.8): respectable
- Physiology & behavior (IF 2.4)
- Cell Reports (IF 7.5, publication fee $5000, 200 days to publication)
- Frontiers in Neuroinformatics (2.5, EUR 3500)
