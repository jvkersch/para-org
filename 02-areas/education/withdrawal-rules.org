* General rules

Permanent withdrawal: student needs to go through re-admission if they want to return.

Leave of absence: not needed.

Stephen’s procedure (2022):
- AA guides student to apply for readmission
- Admissions answers that application is under review.
- Curriculum Committee reviews the case
- Admissions answers the student
- AA guides the student to re-enroll

Re-admission should go via email, not through Oasis, since Oasis doesn’t have a re-admission option and will ask for HR/aptitude test results. 

Situation now is complicated because of 100%/20% rules. These rules “start” (come into effect) as soon as the student re-enrolls.  There could be an exemption made for students who withdraw in the beginning of the AY, but this hasn’t been set up yet (discussion ongoing).
