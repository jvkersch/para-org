* Meeting notes

** 2025-08-08

First meeting of the semester to get back on track. Was hoping to see lots of research effort and independent work, but this has not happened -- very much same mood as last year. Will need to set a big research goal for Solha to explore over the course of this year.

Over the summer, has worked on:

- Competition: made a failing entry because of Docker issues (unfamiliarity with Docker coupled with lack of time due to family commitment). Understandable that this happened, valuable lesson for the future.
- MICCAI workshop paper: segmenting breast cancer tumors by feeding SAM2 images upwards, downwards, or middle-out.
